# CNN_Age_and_Gender_prediction


🔍 Overview
This project uses a deep learning model trained on a large facial dataset to:

📅 Predict age (as a numerical range)

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Predict gender (male/female)

It can be used for research, demographic analysis, or as a module in larger CV systems like attendance, targeted ads, or digital kiosks.

⚙️ Tech Stack
🧠 CNN (TensorFlow and Keras)

📷 OpenCV for image preprocessing & face detection

🔢 NumPy & Pandas

🖼 Pre-trained on dataset UTKFace 

🎥 Real-time Webcam Prediction
Run the app and see live predictions directly from your webcam.
